Automation for Puzzles of Pirates!

## What?
This simple in-development program aims to automate as many puzzles as posible from the game Puzzle Pirates.

## How?
By learning how the puzzles work, using vision to identify its current state, and either use algorithms or brute force the way to an optimun solution!

## Why?
Personal challenge (and spontaneous boredom).
Plus, I needed an excuse to learn vision.
